## About

This is a Markdown parser written from scratch in JavaScript! Here's what it's able to parse:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Italic
* Bold
* Inline code
* Links
* Images
* Code blocks
* Blockquotes
* Horizontal breaks
* Unordered and ordered lists (but not nested ones, currently)

Here's what hasn't been tackled so far:

- [ ] Nested lists
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Footnotes
- [ ] Definition lists
- [ ] Task lists
- [ ] Highlight
- [ ] Heading IDs 

In addition, a basic frontend with `localStorage` has been implemented, allowing you to, create, (auto) save, and delete Markdown files. These were not implemented: 

- [ ] Rename
- [ ] Download Markdown/HTML

## Getting Started

Run `npm i` to install Prettier and `http-server`. Then, run `npm start` to whip up a local HTTP server (which uses `http-server`).

## Thoughts

I built this as part of a 10-day [challenge](https://events.hackclub.com/10-days-in-public/). Read my blog [post](https://www.jianminchen.com/article/general/2022-10-07-markdown-parser) to see my thoughts and process on building this.
