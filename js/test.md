I'm limping to the airport bathroom listening to *Something Just Like This*, The Chainsmokers, blasting on the airport speakers at 3AM in the morning.

My feet are killing me (God, I regret buying these Converse shoes), and I want a Monster so badly, but I'm still smiling goofily like I'm in some sort of fever dream.

I'm writing this sitting on my flight to Salt Lake City. Well, first we're landing in Las Vegas, and I think of Theo in [The Goldfinch](https://hackclub.com), how wide and ever so expansive that book is.
